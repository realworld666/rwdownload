# RW::Download

RW::Download is/was a leading PHP download manager for websites running a MySQL database and allowing integration with leading PHP bulletin board software for user accounts back in the early 2000s. It was built on PHP4 and is now available here in its last known form. 

As the world has moved on from PHP4 and I have had 20 years of software experience since then, I am certain this is not the finest example of PHP development in the 2020s. That said, it is available here for prosperity and for anyone who cares to branch or develop it further. There's some good stuff in here but it is now very dated technology-wise.
