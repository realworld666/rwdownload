This option works more often when suExec is not enabled but can also lead to Error 500\'s in some setups. If this happens you can edit the .htaccess file in the script root directory and remove any line starting \'php_value\'. <br><br>Some servers will not allow any overrides at all in this case all you can do is ask the web hosts to raise the upload limit.",
